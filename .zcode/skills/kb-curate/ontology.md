# GitMark ontology — a knowledge model over code

> Rules for **how to maintain** a knowledge base (not just how to search it). The idea
> is borrowed from **Palantir's Ontology** (Gotham/Foundry): an organization is modeled
> as a graph of typed **objects**, their **properties**, and the **links** between them —
> a "digital twin." GitMark applies the same model to project documentation: every `.md`
> document is an **object** with a **type** and **properties**, and markdown links are
> **typed links**. The result is an ontology not of data, but of **knowledge over code**.

## Semantic layer — Objects, Properties, Links

### Object types (`node_type`)

Each document has exactly one `node_type` — its "table" in the ontology.

| node_type | what it is | lives in |
|---|---|---|
| `service` | overview/index of one service/component | `docs/services/<svc>/README.md` |
| `reference` | cross-cutting spec (not about one service) | `docs/reference/` |
| `runbook` | operational procedure ("how to X") | `docs/ops/` |
| `gotcha` | a pitfall + how to avoid it | `docs/ops/` |
| `decision` | an architectural/product decision (ADR) | `docs/decisions/` |
| `plan` | a plan/design before implementation — the ship contract | `docs/plans/<slug>.md` (file; `to-tickets` promotes it to `docs/plans/<slug>/README.md`) |
| `ticket` | a tracer-bullet vertical slice of a plan, one `/ship` run each | `docs/plans/<slug>/NN-<ticket>.md` |
| `guide` | how to use something (clients, public API) | varies |
| `index` | a folder's table of contents | any `README.md` |
| `schema` | a card schema: the required fields and allowed values of the cards in its folder | the cards' folder, next to them |
| `report` | a read-only report (review, diagnosis, handoff) — lives in `docs/` as a KB document | `docs/` |

Rule: if unsure, a spec is `reference`, a how-to is `guide`. Add a new type only if
none fit and there will be ≥3 such documents.

### Properties (frontmatter)

YAML frontmatter at the top of the file — the "columns" of the object row.

```yaml
---
node_type: service          # REQUIRED — one of the table above
title: Billing              # human-readable object name
service: billing            # which service; use a sentinel (e.g. _platform) for cross-cutting
status: active              # active | draft | deprecated | archived
updated: 2026-06-06          # last meaningful edit (YYYY-MM-DD)
tags: [payments, api]       # free-form labels for search/grouping
links:                      # typed links (see below), optional
  documents: [../../src/billing]
  depends_on: [../reference/architecture.md]
  supersedes: [old-billing.md]
---
```

Required: `node_type`. Strongly recommended for load-bearing docs
(`service|reference|runbook|plan|decision`): `title`, `service`, `status`, `updated`.

`service` is a **controlled vocabulary** you define for your project.

### Link types (`links`)

Links are markdown links `[text](path.md)`. The link type is declared by a key under
`links:`; inline links default to `relates_to`. `gitmark map` draws the graph from them.

| link type | meaning | direction |
|---|---|---|
| `documents` | this doc describes that code/service | doc → code |
| `depends_on` | read that one first to understand this | doc → doc |
| `supersedes` | replaces a stale document | new → old |
| `relates_to` | adjacent topic (default for inline links) | doc ↔ doc |
| `implemented_by` | where it lives in code | doc → source file |
| `part_of` | belongs to a larger index | doc → index |

The doc→code link (`documents`/`implemented_by`) is what makes this an ontology **over
code**: a document is explicitly tied to the files/component it describes.

### Card schemas (`node_type: schema`)

A folder of cards may declare its schema: a document with `node_type: schema` sitting
next to the cards. The declaration is machine-readable — the linter reads it, so a new
card type needs no code change:

```yaml
---
node_type: schema
title: Wallet card
card_type: wallet                  # the node_type the cards of this folder carry
required: [uid, name, kind, balance, observed, available]
values: ["kind: card|cash|ewallet", "available: yes|no"]
---
```

- The schema governs its own folder: every document in it (except the folder's
  `README.md` and the schemas themselves) must declare a `node_type` listed by a folder
  schema, carry each `required` field, and keep `values` fields within the listed set.
  A violation is an error, named by file and field (I9).
- Card fields live in frontmatter; the body stays free prose — schemas do not constrain
  it.
- Schemas are declared where the cards live — in a consumer's KB, not in this package:
  the package knows the format, never a consumer's card types.

## Kinetic layer — Actions (curation rules)

In Palantir, **Actions** sit on top of the semantics — what you can do with objects.
Here, Actions = the **curation procedures** a human/agent runs (see `kb-curate` skill):
CREATE → classify, place, frontmatter, link, index. UPDATE → bump `updated`/`status`.
DEPRECATE → `status` + `supersedes`. LINK → no orphans. REINDEX → `gitmark index`.

## The plan as a ship contract

A plan is a **file** `docs/plans/<slug>.md` (`node_type: plan`) until it is broken into
tickets. `to-tickets` is the only step that creates the **folder form**
`docs/plans/<slug>/`: it moves the file to the folder's `README.md` (history
preserved, links rewritten for the extra depth) and adds the **tickets**
(`NN-<ticket>.md`, `node_type: ticket`) — tracer-bullet vertical slices, each declaring
the tickets that block it.

The plan contract carries the fields the entry skills produce and the dev-flow
consumes:

- `Goal` — why this change (one clear goal)
- `Done` — the observable done-criterion
- `Scope` — files/services touched (required)
- `Constraints` — stop-points: `stop-before-commit`, `stop-after-mr`, `no-deploy`
- `Context` — what the entry phase already established (root cause, prototype verdict,
  resolved design-tree branches)
- `Tickets` — the decomposition, in order, with status (folder form only, added by `to-tickets`)

Each ticket carries: `What to build` (the end-to-end behaviour the slice makes work),
`Blocked by` (the tickets that gate it), `Status`, and acceptance criteria.

**`/ship` executes one ticket at a time, strictly sequentially.** `/ship <folder>` takes
the first ticket (by `NN` order) whose `status` is not `archived`; a finished ticket is
marked `archived`. A **file plan** (`/ship docs/plans/<slug>.md`) is shipped as a single
slice — the full loop on the plan's `Goal`/`Done`, no tickets.

**Lifecycle:** plan `draft` (written by `grilling`) → `active` (`/ship`
started, operator-confirmed) → `archived` (shipped as a single slice, or all tickets
done). Tickets: `draft` (written by `to-tickets`) → `active` (being shipped) →
`archived` (shipped). Only `grilling` authors a plan contract and
`to-tickets` authors tickets; `diagnose`, `prototype`, `handoff`,
`code-review`, `architecture` feed `Context`/`Goal` but never author
them — and never launch `/ship`: the operator starts it by hand. Their own output
(root cause, prototype data, handoff, review report, deepening report) is **ephemeral**:
`.scratch/` or the OS temp dir, never a KB doc.

## Invariants (checked by `gitmark lint`)

- **I1.** Every load-bearing doc has frontmatter with a valid `node_type`.
- **I2.** `node_type`/`service`/`status` values are within their vocabularies.
- **I3.** No orphans: a load-bearing doc has ≥1 incoming or outgoing link — a markdown link
  in the body (either direction) or its own `links:` block.
- **I4.** No broken links — markdown body AND frontmatter `links:` (all types), resolved
  against the filesystem as a reader would: `.md` inside the KB, directories and files
  outside it. Titles, `<>`-wrappers, `#anchors` and `:line`-selectors are stripped and
  URL-encoding decoded; the path is checked where it leads, even outside the repo (the KB is
  read in a multi-repo layout). External URIs, bare anchors and root-absolute `/…` are out
  of scope.
- **I5.** Every `docs/**` folder has a `README.md` index.
- **I6.** A `supersedes` target has `status: deprecated|archived`.
- **I7.** The command registry is in sync: every command the engine discovers — the
  project's `.zcode/commands/*.md` and the package's `commands/*.md` — has `args:`/`drives:`
  frontmatter and a row in the generated summary table; every project command also has a
  `## /cmd` section in `docs/reference/commands.md`, and every such section names a known
  command (checked by `gitmark inventory --check`). The same generated-table contract covers
  the plans registry: the `plans` table in `docs/plans/README.md` is the single carrier of
  plan statuses and ticket counters, regenerated from the carriers' frontmatter. The plans
  target is optional: without `docs/plans/README.md` it stays silent (the missing folder
  index is I5's finding); a README that exists but lacks the marker pair is an ERR —
  exit 2 on regeneration, exit 1 on `--check`.
- **I8.** The knowledge model has not drifted: `docs/ontology.md` and the package copy
  `skills/kb-curate/ontology.md` agree from the first `## ` heading onward (the title and the
  header notes may differ). ERR in the package's own repo, WARN in a consumer.
- **I9.** Card schemas hold: in every folder that declares a schema (`node_type: schema`),
  each document (except the folder's `README.md` and the schemas themselves) declares a
  `node_type` listed by a folder schema, carries every `required` field, and keeps `values`
  fields within the listed set. Reported by file and field; card prose is not constrained.
- **I10.** The index chain holds: every `docs/**` subfolder's `README.md` is reachable by a
  body link from its parent's `README.md`, starting at `docs/README.md`. Body semantics only:
  frontmatter `links:` and links inside code fences do not count; a link to the subfolder
  itself or to its `README.md` both cover it — `#anchors` are not links and never cover.
  A subfolder without a `README.md` is I5's finding, not I10's.

## Why this, not a wiki/Notion

- **md+git** is already the source of truth. The ontology adds *structure on top* without
  changing the medium — frontmatter and links are plain markdown, readable in any viewer.
- The object/link graph gives Foundry-like navigation with no platform: `gitmark map`
  renders it from the same files.
- Types + invariants keep the KB from degrading into a pile as it grows — the exact pain
  Palantir's ontology solves for data, applied here to knowledge over code.
